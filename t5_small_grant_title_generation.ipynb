In contrast to the standard approach where the taxation mechanism is operated by a benevolent planner with full commitment power, we focus on economies in which policy decisions are made by self-interested politicians, who cannot commit to policies. The society controls politicians using elections. We show that the provision of incentives to politicians can be partly separated from redistribution across agents and that political economy constraints can be modeled as introducing additional aggregate distortions in the dynamic Mirrlees problem. We provide conditions under which the political economy distortions persist or disappear in the long run. If the politicians are as patient as the agents, the \\u201cbest sustainable mechanism\\u201d leads to an asymptotic allocation where the aggregate distortions arising from political economy disappear. In contrast, when politicians are less patient than the citizens, positive aggregate labor and capital taxes remain even asymptotically.

Learning is online because cost functions are revealed sequentially and distributed because they are revealed to agents of a network that can exchange information with neighboring nodes only. Learning is measured in terms of the global network regret, which is defined here as the accumulated loss of causal prediction with respect to a centralized clairvoyant agent to which the information of all times and agents is revealed at the initial time. A variant of the Arrow-Hurwicz saddle point algorithm is proposed to control the growth of global network regret. This algorithm uses Lagrange multipliers to penalize the discrepancies between agents and leads to an implementation that relies on local operations and exchange of variables between neighbors. We show that decisions made with this saddle point algorithm lead to regret whose order is not larger than O(\\u221aT), where T is the total operating time. Numerical behavior is illustrated for the particular case of distributed recursive least squares. An application to computer network security in which service providers cooperate to detect the signature of malicious users is developed to illustrate the practical value of the proposed algorithm.\", \"output\": \"A Saddle Point Algorithm for Networked Online Convex Optimization\"}\n",

In contrast to the standard approach where the taxation mechanism is operated by a benevolent planner with full commitment power, we focus on economies in which policy decisions are made by self-interested politicians, who cannot commit to policies. The society controls politicians using elections. We show that the provision of incentives to politicians can be partly separated from redistribution across agents and that political economy constraints can be modeled as introducing additional aggregate distortions in the dynamic Mirrlees problem. We provide conditions under which the political economy distortions persist or disappear in the long run. If the politicians are as patient as the agents, the “best sustainable mechanism” leads to an asymptotic allocation where the aggregate distortions arising from political economy disappear. In contrast, when politicians are less patient than the citizens, positive aggregate labor and capital taxes remain even asymptotically. We conclude by providing a brief comparison of centralized\n",

New results on tidal circularization are combined with existing data to test and constrain theoretical predictions of tidal circularization in the pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase and throughout the main-sequence phase of stellar evolution. Current data suggest that tidal circularization during the PMS phase sets the tidal cutoff period for binary populations younger than ~ 1 Gyr. Binary populations older than ~ 1 Gyr show increasing tidal cutoff periods with age, consistent with active main-sequence tidal circularization.\n",

            "Input (Abstract): An algorithm to learn optimal actions in convex distributed online problems is developed. Learning is online because cost functions are revealed sequentially and distributed because they are revealed to agents of a network that can exchange information with neighboring nodes only. Learning is measured in terms of the global network regret, which is defined here as the accumulated loss of causal prediction with respect to a centralized clairvoyant agent to which the information of all times and agents is revealed at the initial time. A variant of the Arrow-Hurwicz saddle point algorithm is proposed to control the growth of global network regret. This algorithm uses Lagrange multipliers to penalize the discrepancies between agents and leads to an implementation that relies on local operations and exchange of variables between neighbors. We show that decisions made with this saddle point algorithm lead to regret whose order is not larger than O(√T), where T is the total operating time. Numerical behavior is illustrated for the particular case of distributed recursive least squares. An application to computer network security in which service providers cooperate to detect the signature of malicious users is developed to illustrate the practical value of the proposed algorithm.\n",

We assume that the data are collected from n subjects, each of which consists of T possibly dependent observations. The graphical models of subjects vary, but are assumed to change smoothly corresponding to a measure of closeness between subjects. We propose a kernel‐based method for jointly estimating all graphical models. Theoretically, under a double asymptotic framework, where both (T,n) and the dimension d can increase, we provide an explicit rate of convergence in parameter estimation. It characterizes the strength that one can borrow across different individuals and the effect of data dependence on parameter estimation. Empirically, experiments on both synthetic and real resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data illustrate the effectiveness of the method proposed.\n",

            "Input (Abstract): BL Lacertae (Lac) objects that are detected at very high energies (VHE) are of fundamental importance to study multiple astrophysical processes, including the physics of jets, the properties of the extragalactic background light and the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field. Unfortunately, since most blazars have featureless optical spectra that preclude a redshift determination, a substantial fraction of these VHE extragalactic sources cannot be used for cosmological studies. To assess whether molecular lines are a viable way to establish distances, we have undertaken a pilot programme at the Institut of Millimetrique (IRAM) 30 m telescope to search for CO lines in three BL Lac objects with known redshifts. We report a positive detection of  M⊙ towards 1ES 1959+650, but due to the poor quality of the baseline, this value is affected by a large systematic uncertainty. For the remaining two sources, W Comae and RGB J0710+591, we derive 3σ upper limits at, respectively, and 1.6 × 109  M⊙, assuming a line width of 150 km s−1 and a standard conversion factor α = 4  M⊙ (K km s−1 pc2)−1. If these low molecular gas masses are typical for blazars, blind redshift searches in molecular lines are currently unfeasible. However, deep observations are still a promising way to obtain precise redshifts for sources whose approximate distances are known via indirect methods. Our observations further reveal a deficiency of molecular gas in BL Lac objects compared to quasars, suggesting that the host galaxies of these two types of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are not drawn from the same parent population. Future observations are needed to assess whether this discrepancy is statistically significant, but our pilot programme shows how studies of the interstellar medium in AGN can provide key information to explore the connection between the active nuclei and the host galaxies.\n",

            "Input (Abstract): The random first-order transition theory of the structural glass transition is reviewed in a pedagogical fashion. The rigidity that emerges in crystals and glassy liquids is of the same fundamental origin. In both cases, it corresponds with a breaking of the translational symmetry; analogies with freezing transitions in spin systems can also be made. The common aspect of these seemingly distinct phenomena is a spontaneous emergence of the molecular field, a venerable and well-understood concept. In crucial distinction from periodic crystallisation, the free energy landscape of a glassy liquid is vastly degenerate, which gives rise to new length and time scales while rendering the emergence of rigidity gradual. We obviate the standard notion that to be mechanically stable a structure must be essentially unique; instead, we show that bulk degeneracy is perfectly allowed but should not exceed a certain value. The present microscopic description thus explains both crystallisation and the emergence of the landscape regime followed by vitrification in a unified, thermodynamics-rooted fashion. The article contains a self-contained exposition of the basics of the classical density functional theory and liquid theory, which are subsequently used to quantitatively estimate, without using adjustable parameters, the key attributes of glassy liquids, viz., the relaxation barriers, glass transition temperature, and cooperativity size. These results are then used to quantitatively discuss many diverse glassy phenomena, including the intrinsic connection between the excess liquid entropy and relaxation rates, the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of α-relaxation, the dynamic heterogeneity, violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, glass ageing and rejuvenation, rheological and mechanical anomalies, super-stable glasses, enhanced crystallisation near the glass transition, the excess heat capacity and phonon scattering at cryogenic temperatures, the Boson peak and plateau in thermal conductivity, and the puzzling midgap electronic states in amorphous chalcogenides.\n",

We show that the reform expanded credit to riskier, self-employed borrowers who purchased newer, more expensive cars. The legal change has led to larger loans with lower spreads and longer maturities. Although the credit reform improved riskier borrowers' access to credit, it also led to increased incidences of delinquency and default. Our results shed light on the consequences of a credit reform and highlight the crucial role that collateral and repossession play in the liberalization and democratization of credit.\n",
